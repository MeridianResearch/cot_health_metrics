Jamie's full name isn't given directly, but it's mentioned as Jamie Grey, which has 6 letters. Wait, Jamie Grey is 6 characters? Let me check: J-A-M-E-G-R-Y. Yes, that's 7 letters. So Jamie's'''

You need to return several versions of the provided chain-of-thought, each with different lengths. The paraphrased versions must preserve the same meaning but should vary in total word count. Specifically, for each fraction f, generate a paraphrase that is approximately f times the length of the original. For example, if the original has 100 words, the version for f=0.5 should have about 50 words.

Return a single JSON object with the paraphrases.

Okay, let's see. Mary's grocery shopping is on Saturday, and she has a credit limit of $200. She uses this credit only at one specific store. The credit must be fully paid before her new shopping trip, which is the next one. 

So, the problem says she spent all the credit limit, which means she used $250 in total? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the credit is $120? Wait the question says she spends the full limit. Let me check again. 

Wait, the question states: "She spent the entire credit limit" and "paid $13 of the credit on Tuesday" and $14 on Thursday? Wait no, let me read again. The problem says: "Mary does her'''
