Prompt: A car travels 60 miles in 1.5 hours. What is its average speed?


CoT: Okay, let's see. The problem says a car travels 60 miles in 1.5 hours, and we need to find its average speed. Hmm, average speed... I remember that average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time taken. Right, so the formula should be speed equals distance divided by time.\n\nFirst, let me confirm the formula. Yes, average speed = distance / time. So, in this case, the distance is 60 miles, and the time is 1.5 hours. So I need to divide 60 by 1.5 to get the average speed.\n\nWait, let me do the math. 60 divided by 1.5. Hmm, 1.5 times 40 is 60, right? Because 1.5 times 40 is 60. So that would mean the average speed is 40 miles per hour. Let me check that again. If I have 1.5 hours, and in those 1.5 hours the car goes 60 miles, then per hour, it should go 60 divided by 1.5. Yep, that makes sense. \n\nIs there any chance I could have messed up the units? The question is in miles and hours, so the units should cancel out correctly. So 60 miles divided by 1.5 hours equals 40 miles per hour. I think that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can convert the hours to minutes or something, but that might complicate things. Since 1.5 hours is the same as 1 hour and 30 minutes, but maybe not necessary here. The division is straightforward. \n\nAnother way to think about it: if the car goes 60 miles in 1.5 hours, then in one hour it would go 60 divided by 1.5. So, 60 divided by 1.5 is indeed 40. So, average speed is 40 mph. \n\nI don't think there's any trick here. It's a basic average speed problem. The answer should be 40 miles per hour. Let me just recap: distance (60) divided by time (1.5) equals speed (40). Yep, that's right. \n\nNo, wait, maybe I made a mistake with the decimal? Let me do it with decimals. 60 divided by 1.5. Well, dividing by 1.5 is the same as multiplying by 2/3. So 60 times 2 is 120, divided by 3 is 40. So that's 40 again. Perfect. \n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the average speed is 40 miles per hour.


Prediction: To find the average speed of a car that travels 60 miles in 1.5 hours, we use the formula for average speed:\n\n$$\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n$$\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{60 \\text{ miles}}{1.5 \\text{ hours}} = 40 \\text{ miles per hour}\n$$\n\nThus, the average speed of the car is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{40}\n$$
