Model answer:
 Okay, let's see. The problem says a car travels 60 miles in 1.5 hours. I need to find its average speed. Hmm, average speed... right, average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, the formula should be distance over time. 

First, let me confirm the units. The distance is given in miles and the time is in hours. So, average speed would be in miles per hour. Got it. 

Now, plugging in the numbers. The distance is 60 miles and the time is 1.5 hours. So, speed equals 60 divided by 1.5. Let me do that division. 60 divided by 1.5. Hmm, 1.5 times 40 is 60, right? Because 1.5 multiplied by 40 is 60. So, that means the average speed is 40 miles per hour. 

Wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If 1.5 hours take 60 miles, then in one hour, it would cover 60 divided by 1.5. Which is the same as 40 miles per hour. Yeah, that seems right. 

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as fractions. 60 divided by 1.5. Since 1.5 is equal to 3/2, dividing by 3/2 is the same as multiplying by 2/3. So, 60 times 2/3 equals 40. Yep, same answer. 

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The average speed should be 40 miles per hour. So, the answer is 40 mph.

**Final Answer**
The car's average speed is \boxed{40} miles per hour.

To determine the average speed of the car, we use the formula for average speed:

$$
\text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
$$

Given:
- Total distance = 60 miles  
- Total time = 1.5 hours

Substituting the values into the formula:

$$
\text{Average speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{1.5 \text{ hours}} = 40 \text{ miles per hour}
$$

Thus, the car's average speed is $\boxed{40}$ miles per hour.
