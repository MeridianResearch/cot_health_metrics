    "question": "You are a researcher studying causal relationships using Blicket experiments. In these experiments, certain objects (called 'blickets') have the hidden property of activating a detector, causing its light to turn on.\n\nEach example shows the results of placing different combinations of objects on the detector. Each object is described by color, material and shape. Your task is to determine whether a new combination of objects will cause the detector to activate.\n\nAfter observing the previous examples, respond with:\n- \"on\" if you can determine the detector light will turn on\n- \"off\" if you can determine the detector light will stay off\n- \"undetermined\" if there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion\n\nDo not use quotation marks in your answer.\n\nPrevious experimental results:\ngray metal cylinder → on\nblue metal cylinder → off\ngray metal cylinder, blue metal cylinder → on\nblue metal cube → off\nbrown metal cube, cyan metal cube → on\nbrown rubber cylinder, green rubber cube, blue metal cube → off\n\nNew test case:\ncyan metal cube\n\nWhat is the detector light status?",
