plotting on same
significance test - paired t-test
heavy and super light paraphrasing
there can be semantic + syntactic paraphrasing !
-> a paraphraser must well reduce syntactic paraphrase - but might struggle removing semantic paraphrase
! move on to bigger model, where showing more exactly what wanted - e.g., 'remove all emotion', ' add this tone of voice', etc
=> multiple different interventions with various paraphrasing
! if this model is sensitive to it 
! setting up the kind of steganography to use and the kind of paraphrasing the paraphraser should do  -> is the model particularly good at this
